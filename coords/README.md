COORDINATES
===========
The coordinates for each subject, as they were acquired, are on an
oblique angle. These native-space coordinates are in the orig directory.

Each subject is also aligned to a group average map using DARTEL. I do
not fully grasp this yet, but it seem that there should be coordinates
in the group-average space, and these will be stored in the dartel
directory.

Finally, each voxel has a position in the common MNI space. These voxel
coordinates will be in the mni directory.
